-
- Choose the NRC sites (I need to change this from choosing specifically NRC sites to choosing sites that match a particular RegEx.
-
- Choose the least often picked (inverse weighted random)
-
    - read each candidate's 'pick' stats
    - inverse the ticket quantities
        - if anyone has a 0 weight, give everyone an additional ticket
- Choose sites with the most hits (weighted random)
-
    - read each candidate's 'success' stats
        - if anyone has a 0 weight, give everyone an additional ticket
- Choose sites with best hit/pick ratio (weighted random)
-
    - read each candidate's 'success' stats
        - if anyone has a 0 weight, give everyone an additional ticket
- Shuffle the chosen
-
- Simulate a success
-
- Update the stats
-
- Output the stats to screen (for testing)
-
- Write stats to file
-


TODO
----

* change the formula that calculates the number of tickets when reading the best hit/pick ratio to multiply by a different number (perhaps the reciprical of something...)
